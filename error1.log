The purpose of the Python function get_views_ownership_usage_privs_list appears to be to take certain input data (scan_id, acct_id, result), and combine this data with an existing list (views_ownership_usage_privs_list) to create a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the resulting list represents some properties of an item in the result.

Here's what this function does step by step:

It takes four parameters as input:

scan_id: This is presumably an identifier for a scanning operation.
acct_id: This is presumably an account identifier.
views_ownership_usage_privs_list: This is an existing list that contains dictionaries.
result: This is presumably a collection of data, possibly a list of namedtuples.
The function starts by printing the initial state of the result and views_ownership_usage_privs_list lists.

It then iterates over each element in the result collection. Each element appears to be a named tuple because it is converted to a dictionary using _asdict().

For each element in result, it extracts specific fields from the named tuple (e.g., 'rolname', 'current_db', 'object_type', etc.) and creates a dictionary containing these fields along with scan_id and acct_id.

This dictionary is then appended to the views_ownership_usage_privs_list list.

After processing all elements in result, the function returns the updated views_ownership_usage_privs_list, which now contains additional dictionaries representing the properties of the items in result.

In summary, this function takes data from result, processes it, and adds the processed data to an existing list of dictionaries, which is then returned as the result. It's a way to combine and transform data into a specific format for further analysis or use.
