The SQL query you provided is retrieving information about roles and their relationships in a PostgreSQL database. Here's a breakdown of what the query is doing step by step:

It selects several columns from different PostgreSQL system tables:

a.oid as user_role_id: This renames the oid column from the pg_roles table to user_role_id in the result.
a.rolname as user_role_name: This renames the rolname column from the pg_roles table to user_role_name in the result.
b.roleid as other_role_id: This renames the roleid column from the pg_auth_members table to other_role_id in the result.
c.rolname as other_role_name: This renames the rolname column from the second instance of the pg_roles table (aliased as c) to other_role_name in the result.
It specifies the source tables and their relationships:

pg_roles a is the primary source table, and it is aliased as a.
pg_auth_members b is joined with pg_roles a using an inner join based on the condition that a.oid equals b.member. This means it's connecting roles in a to their associated members in b.
pg_roles c is joined with pg_auth_members b using an inner join based on the condition that b.roleid equals c.oid. This means it's connecting the members in b to their corresponding roles in c.
In summary, the query retrieves information about roles (user_role_id and user_role_name) and their relationships to other roles (other_role_id and other_role_name) in the database. It does this by joining the pg_roles, pg_auth_members, and another instance of pg_roles tables to establish the connections between these roles and their associated members or other roles.
