Error: Instance cannot be destroyed
on .terraform/modules/edm_lambda/main.tf line 33:
resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_role" {
Resource module.edm_lambda["drift-detection-test-new-experiment-core"].aws_iam_role.lambda_role[0] has lifecycle.prevent_destroy set, but the plan calls for this resource to be destroyed. To avoid this error and continue with the plan, either disable lifecycle.prevent_destroy or reduce the scope of the plan using the -target flag.
