Hello Michael,

I've returned from India and resumed office today. I'm still dealing with significant jet lag, and as we discussed, I plan to commence the Bank's tasks and activities starting tomorrow. I've confirmed my access and can connect to the Bank's network without any issues. All applications, including my AWS access, IDEs, Appgate SDP clients, TF Cloud, and GitHub, are functioning well for me.
